##### Note : Since only Raspberry pi 3 Model B and Arduino UNO were available for our use (which aren't compatible for the project as they don't have the minimum RAM requirements to run tensorflow), the arduino codes weren't tested  using any microcontroller and have been written solely based on our understanding.

## DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project has been divided into two parts (based on dataset). First part is anomaly detection on a credit card fraud dataset using tinyML and the other is Network Anomaly detection using tinyML. Two folders have been created for the same with further description about what is being done. 

For easy deployment of tensorflowLite for mmicrocontroller model to Arduino, [EloquentTinyML](https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentTinyML) was used.
